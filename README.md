# Netflix Clone React
This application (a Netflix clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled Components. I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage. There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.
### Installed:
```
### dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:3000
$ npm start
```
Navigate to http://localhost:3000. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files
